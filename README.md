Create a public space:
where user can connect with other users by uploding Picture and videos 
as well as comments , like and share . user can post only 1 time a day . 
if the user have 2 friend they can post 2 times a day and
if they have more than 10 friend they can post multiple time a day.
if they do not have any friends they cannot post anything on the public page

IMPORTANT NOTE: while deploy the project i used railway( for db) render(for backend ) and vercel(for frontend)
All platforms i used are free tier so basically while using the site while click on link refresh the page first ( for awaken the backend) .
dont rush if it dont response immediately wait for bit cause(as per free tier it will take time) for response to your requests like login regiter etc
